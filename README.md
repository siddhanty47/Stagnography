# Steganography
* Steganography is a technique to hide data behind a multimedia file(like images, videos or audio files).

In this project we try to make a safer communication algo in which we use a secret text message(text.txt) to encrpt using RSA and an image(img.png) to work as cover to hide the encrypted data behind the image.

### How to use:
* Run code.py. you will see a UI.
* For encryption select an image to be used as cover and a text message to hide.
* Encryption will save an encrpted_image.png file with hidden data in the directory.
* For decryption selected the encrypted_image.png and you will get the hidden text message back.
